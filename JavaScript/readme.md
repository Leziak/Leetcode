The names of the files are equal to the names of the challenges presented on the **Leetcode** website.

The solutions are not always optimal; there are two at this moment that would be considered too slow to pass, due to using brute force.
 
I use recursion sparingly simply because for loops are almost always faster, and speed as well as memory usage are important factors in Leetcode challenges. Also, I use JavaScript because it is my strongest language and the reader also probably uses or used JavaScript before.
